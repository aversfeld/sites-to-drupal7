# sites-to-drupal7
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/sites-to-drupal7

This was a bit of a hack to migrate a website away from Google Sites and into Drupal.  
Extraction from Sites was done using Google's own tool (https://code.google.com/p/google-sites-liberation/).
Sites-to-Drupal7 parses the google output, and loads it into Drupal7 via xml-rpc.
